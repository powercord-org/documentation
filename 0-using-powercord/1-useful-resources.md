# Useful Resources
Powercord provides a lot of features out of the box, but the community also put some work into making developer's life
easier when using Powercord or working with our APIs. 

Since they are very useful and made by very cute people we've listed them all here so you can easily find some
good high™️ quality™️ stuff.

>warn
> While we list them here, the Powercord Staff is not maintaining nor endorsing those. If you happen to find

## Powercord Manifest Generator
 - By [ghostlydilemma](https://github.com/ghostlydilemma) aka emma 🌺
 - https://ghostlydilemma.github.io/powercord-manifest-generator

A visual tool that lets you create manifests for both plugins and themes without having to bother writing
the JSON structure yourself.

A VSCode extension that adds useful snippets to develop plugins *faster*. 🚀

**To install**: Launch VS Code Quick Open (Ctrl+P), paste `ext install marvin.powercord-snippets`, and press enter.

## BetterDiscord Theme Converter
 - By [creatable](https://github.com/Cr3atable)
 - https://cr3atable.github.io/Powerconvert

A stupidly simple tool that'll convert your BetterDiscord theme to a Powercord theme (will give you a zip with both
the theme and the manifest file). Supports both old and new META format.

>info
> Themes using BetterDiscord normalized classes (.da-) won't be able to be converted using this tool. There's also
> additional factors that may make the theme malfunctioning (blocked remote resources, ...).

## BetterDiscord Compatibility Layer
 - By [Juby210](https://github.com/Juby210)
 - https://github.com/Juby210/bdCompat
<!-- - [See in the Plugins Store]() -->

A compatibility layer that lets you run BetterDiscord plugins directly in Powercord. It can also provide
EnhancedDiscord compatibiliy through a [BD plugin](https://github.com/Juby210/EDPluginsLoader)

>warn
> While a decent effort is being made to ensure compatibility, BetterDiscord is a completely different environment
> compared to Powercord. Expect some plugins to be incompatible, and some hiccups to occur.
