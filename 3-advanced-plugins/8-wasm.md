# WebAssembly

>warn
> WebAssembly is meant to accelerate computationally-heavy workloads or to use libraries written in native languages
> like FFmpeg. It is by no means an alternative way to write plugin, and should not be used for this purpose.
>
> Non-appropriated use of WebAssembly, such as simply to avoid JavaScript will not be accepted in the store. Not only
> the overall efficiency of your plugin would suffer, WebAssembly binaries are way harder to audit and will lower
> the trust users have towards your plugin.
