## How to publish?
Once your theme is ready, you can go to the Powercord Store, in the section "Get in touch", go to "Publish a product"
and from there you'll be reminded the requirements, and you'll be able to fill the form. Note that a linked Powercord
account is required to submit forms.

### I've seen verified tickmarks, what are those?
For the greatest of the greatest themes on Powercord, we offer a verification program to let developers have the
recognition they deserve for making Powercord as beautiful as it is today. The form is also in the Powercord Store!
