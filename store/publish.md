# Publish your work
You just finished making your plugin or theme and want to publish it onto the Powercord Store? Great!

## Requirements
To ensure the Powercord ecosystem stays awesome and safe, there is a set of requirements you must meet before getting
a place in the store.

 - Comply with our [guidelines](https://powercord.dev/guidelines)

The guidelines are here to ensure a safe environment for everyone, and define the boundaries of what constitutes
"modding" and "abuse".

 - Be in a functional state, with a proper manifest file

This form isn't to claim a future spot, it's to release a finished work (or at least something that has a basic
feature set) ready to be installed. The manifest file must reflect a proper name, author(s), description, and
everything that's applicable.

 - Code must not be obfuscated, or made intentionally hard to read

Users must be able to easily poke at the source code and look through its logic without obstacles.

## Post-approval process
Once you've been approved, you'll receive a repository in the Powercord's Community organization, which will be the
repository used by the store to fetch from.
