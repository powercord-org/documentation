# Copyright Policy
We take copyright protection seriously and ensure all of the works published on the Powercord Store are all done
within the respect of everyone's rights. But sometimes, some infringing content may pass undetected by us.

Every decision on this matter will be done after carefully investigating the case and decisions are always agreed by
multiple Powercord Staff members.

## Report a copyright violation
If you found content that you own that is in violation of your copyright, you can report it to us using the built-in
"report" feature within the Powercord Store, or simply contact a Powercord Staff member (either by DM, or in our
[support server](https://discord.gg/gs4ZMbBfCh), preferably in the misc-support category).

If the content happens to be in violation of your copyright, we will remove it from the store and notify the user
about this matter. If only a part of the work is infringing, they'll be invited to remove said part so their work
can be brought back up.

## Appeal a takedown
Whenever one of your work is taken down for copyright issues, you will be notified by a Powercord Staff member who
will explain the reason of the takedown. This is a great moment to appeal if you feel the takedown is inappropriate
or if there is a misunderstanding.

If your appeal is successful, we will bring back up your work and notify the claimant about it. If your appeal is not
successful, you will unfortunately have no second appeal chance and the work will remain down unless appropriate
modifications are done.

## "But my friend said it was ok!"
If you are unable to prove an agreement between you and the copyright holder has been established, we will not be able
to accept appeals based on this type of argument. Note that screenshots of Discord messages (or screenshots from an
external platform) are not receivable as an evidence, as they can easily be faked. Matters of copyright are serious
and can go beyond simple disagreement in an online chat.

## Repeated offender policy
People who are found to repeatedly publish content in violation of someone's copyright will see their right to publish
plugins and themes revoked.

People found to repeatedly send false copyright violation reports will also see their access to reporting features
disabled.
